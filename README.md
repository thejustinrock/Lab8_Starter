# Lab 8 - Starter

1. It seems that it would be within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed is the better option. Also, to test code manually will takes alot of time. In addition, testing the project after development will create problems so finding the problems earlier would be better.

2. No, because end to end testing is more for user action instead.
   
3. No, because it seems that a message would appeal to many features of the project and will cause problem of the unit testing.

4. Yes, I would use the unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application because it can test without causing many features so it could be indepedently tested.
