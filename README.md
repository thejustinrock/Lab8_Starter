# Lab 8 - Starter

1. It seems that it would be within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed is the better option. Also, to test code manually will takes alot of time. In addition, testinf the project after development will create problems so finding the problems earlier would be better.

2. No, because E2E is only for mulatng user's action from beginning until the end.

3. No, because it seems that a message would appeal to many features of the project and will cause problem of the unit testing.

4. Yes, I would use the unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application because it can test without causing many features.
